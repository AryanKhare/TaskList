# Task List

Build a task list or a todo list, using `Angular & Angular CLI` to learn the basics of angular.

Taking the reference from [DevChallenges.io](www.devchallenge.io) task assignment.

Currently working on the frontend part only, but in future, will convert it to full-stack. I'm not using any database storing all the tasks in the `localStorage`.


## Current Features

* Each `Task` must have a title, description is optional and an icon.
* User can add, edit and delete the task.
* User can edit the description, icon and status of the task.
* There are three type of status of the task, `InProgress` `Completed` and `Won't work on`.
* User can edit the board name and the borad description.


## Future Scope

* Implement the backend for this application.
* Using database as `MongoDB`.
* When user first visit the board, a `Unique ID` is created and saved to the database, when the user makes the first changes.
* Each board can be accessed by a unique board Id, i.e `/board/:board-id`.
* Tack all the changes using `Git`.


## Learning 

* Basics of `Angular`.
* Data transfer from parent to child & child to parent components.
* Form Handling using, `Reactive Forms` of Angular.
* `Typescript` type handling, defining types with `optional` and `non-nullable` fields.
* Using `Angular Services` to share component data and connect to the backend.
* Implementing the `state management` of angular application.
* How to work with `RxJs` & `NgRx`.
* How to make angular application responsive.
* Creating the application structure.
* Form Validation
* Understanding `@ViewChild` in angular
